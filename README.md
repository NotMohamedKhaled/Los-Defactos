# Los Defactos — Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform

A production-style, full-stack online fashion store built as a **monorepo** with a modern **Angular** storefront and a **Node.js / Express** REST API backed by **MongoDB**. The application covers the complete retail lifecycle—from product discovery and variant-aware inventory to checkout, payments, order fulfillment, and a full **admin management portal**.

> **Note:** This project is designed for **local demonstration** and portfolio review. It is not currently deployed to a public environment; screenshots and this documentation are intended to communicate scope and engineering quality without a live URL.

## Project Overview

**Los Defactos** is a B2C e-commerce platform for apparel and accessories. Customers browse a categorized catalog, configure products by **color and size**, manage a persistent cart, and complete checkout with **shipping details** and **Stripe** payment integration. Registered users track orders, update profiles (including saved shipping addresses), and submit testimonials.

Administrators operate a separate **dashboard** to manage users, products (with variant-level stock), categories, subcategories, FAQs, testimonials, and order status—using soft-delete patterns, pagination, and Cloudinary-backed media uploads.

The frontend follows a dedicated **design system** (documented in `frontend/DESIGN.md`) with Tailwind CSS tokens, responsive layouts, and accessible form validation.

## System Architecture

The application uses a **decoupled client–server** architecture: the Angular SPA communicates with the REST API over HTTP; the API persists data in MongoDB and integrates with Stripe and Cloudinary.

  end

```

### Request flow (example: checkout)

1. User adds items to cart → `POST/PUT` cart endpoints persist line items and delivery choice.
2. User opens checkout → `authGuard` ensures a valid JWT.
3. Frontend requests `POST /payment/create-payment-intent` → server computes subtotal, delivery, and tax, returns Stripe `clientSecret`.
4. On successful payment, order is created with a **shipping snapshot** (`shippingName`, `email`, `phone`, `address[]`).
5. Cart is cleared; user views the order under **My Orders**.

## Key Functionalities

### Authentication & authorization

- **Registration / login** with hashed passwords (`bcrypt`)
- **JWT** stored client-side; attached to API requests
- **`authGuard`** — protects checkout, orders, and profile
- **`adminGuard`** — restricts `/dashboard` to `role: admin`
- **Stricter rate limiting** on login to reduce brute-force risk

### Product catalog & inventory

- Products linked to **category** and **subcategory**
- **Variants** per color/size with individual SKU and stock
- Admin **variant stock matrix** and dedicated **restock** workflow
- **Soft delete** for products, categories, and subcategories (restore supported)
- **Slug-based** product URLs for SEO-friendly routing
- Optional **`npm run seed:products`** to populate sample catalog data

### Cart & orders

- Cart tied to authenticated user; syncs on login
- Delivery options with fees applied server-side
- Orders store line items, totals, status, and **immutable shipping snapshot** at checkout
- User orders support **pagination**; admin can update order status

### Payments

- Stripe **PaymentIntent** created from server-validated cart totals
- Tax and delivery aligned between frontend display and backend calculation

### Media management

- Admin uploads for product and category images
- Files validated (type, size), uploaded to **Cloudinary**, URL stored in MongoDB
- `imageUrl` pipe normalizes CDN URLs across storefront and admin

### Forms & validation

- Shared utilities in `form-validators.util.ts`: sanitization, custom validators (`phone`, `zip`, `noHtml`, password strength)
- Reactive forms on **register**, **checkout**, and **admin** modals with inline error display

---

## Security & Data Integrity

- **Helmet** with CSP allowing Cloudinary image sources
- **Global rate limiting** (100 requests / 15 min per IP) + **auth rate limiting** (10 / hour on login)
- **CORS** restricted to configured frontend origins
- **Role middleware** on admin routes
- **Input sanitization** on the client before API submission; server-side validation on models
- **Secrets** via environment variables (never committed—see `.gitignore`)

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (20 LTS recommended)
- **npm**
- **MongoDB** (local instance or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) connection string)
- **Stripe** test keys (for checkout)
- **Cloudinary** account (for admin image uploads)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NotMohamedKhaled/Los-Defactos
cd LosDefactos
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file (use `envExample.txt` and `.env.example` as references):

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
copy envExample.txt .env
# Then edit .env with your real values
```

Start the API:

```bash
npm start
```

The server listens on **`http://localhost:3000`** (default).

**Optional — seed sample products** (requires categories/subcategories in DB or seed dependencies as defined in the seed script):

```bash
npm run seed:products
```

### 3. Frontend setup

Open a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The Angular dev server runs at **`http://localhost:4200`**.

Update `frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` if your API port or Stripe publishable key differs:

```typescript
apiURL: 'http://localhost:3000/',
stripePublishableKey: 'pk_test_...',
```

### 4. Create an admin user

1. Register a new account via **`/signup`**.
2. In MongoDB, set that user's `role` field to **`admin`**:

```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "you@example.com" },
  { $set: { role: "admin" } }
)
```

3. Log in again and navigate to **`/dashboard`**.

### 5. Verify the application

| URL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `http://localhost:4200/home` | Storefront home |
| `http://localhost:4200/products` | Product listing |
| `http://localhost:4200/login` | Authentication |
| `http://localhost:4200/dashboard` | Admin portal (admin only) |

- **Observability** — Centralized logging, health checks, error monitoring (Sentry)
- **Search** — Full-text search (MongoDB Atlas Search or Elasticsearch)
- **Email** — Order confirmations and password reset via transactional email
- **Inventory alerts** — Low-stock notifications for admins
